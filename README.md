# Computing Transfer Entropy Using the Perron-Frobenius Operator
## This repository contains notes and code for the methods used in the publication: Diego et al. Phys Rev E 99, 2019.
## In the branch: Intersection_of_Simplices, I provide an algorithm for the computation of the volume of intersection between arbitrary simplices in d dimensions together with theoretical basis for that algorithm.
